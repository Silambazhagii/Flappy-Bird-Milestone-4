    <p class="instruc">To play Flappy Bird, tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and navigate through openings
        in green pipes. Timing is crucial; tap to maintain the bird's altitude, avoiding collisions. After every 5
        seconds, you earns a point. Hitting a pipe, the ground, or flying too high results in a game over. Practice,
        persistence, and a steady hand are key to achieving a high score in this challenging and addictive game. Stay
        focused and enjoy the challenge!</p>
